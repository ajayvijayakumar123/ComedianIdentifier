Trevor Noah,251,42,There are many debates in life that don't really have answers. Could LeBron have beaten Michael Jordan? Could Mike Tyson have beaten Muhammad Ali? Could Bert beat Ernie I know they're friends? I know they're friends but there's real anger there folks.
Trevor Noah,117,22,Could Donald Trump have beaten Obama in a race? Not a footrace. We know the answer to that question: a campaign race.
Trevor Noah,134,24,"This weekend, with just eight days, with just eight weeks. Non eight days. You guys like "" eight days away? It's not eight days away."""
Trevor Noah,109,19,It's on President Obama versus President Trump. The leader versus the tweeter. Yes We Can versus way too tan.
Trevor Noah,102,18,And you know Donald Trump's not gonna stand by and let someone take credit for their own achievements.
Trevor Noah,182,39,"Yes I guess this is exciting. The same way I was exciting to be on the plane that Sully landed on the Hudson River. It was like ""I think we are gonna die, but it's gonna be a movie!"""
Trevor Noah,80,14,They couldn't be more different. It's like night and day like ebony and Anarchy.
Trevor Noah,85,13,"""California has just become one really large person."" What you talking about Willies?"
Trevor Noah,176,33,"I've heard a lot of criticism about Obamacare but I can safely say I've never heard that it's gonna morph estates into a very giant person, like, like what does that even mean?"
Trevor Noah,132,27,"I hate to say it but Donald Trump is right Obama is great for sleeping because when he was president we all slept so good, so good. "
Trevor Noah,271,53,But now that Trump's in charge we all lie in bed awake every night trying to figure out how the (beep) California turned into a giant man. Does he get one vote in the Senate. All the people inside of him did they leave before it happened? So many questions I can't sleep!
Trevor Noah,127,26,"Yo, yo. I could honestly listen to Trump try to say ""anomynish"" for the rest of my life. It sounds like a dope new Migos track."
Trevor Noah,135,24,"Yeah, Obama's got a good point. Just say it Trump.  ""Yes, Nashis are...  Sorry, Nashis are... I guess there's fine people on both sides."""
Trevor Noah,180,31,"Yeah. Obama should just be out there, like, ""Uh, this guy, uh, can't even say 'anonymous'. Uh, I remember when presidents could speak the language of the countries they were from."""
Trevor Noah,420,75,"He should just roast him! He should,  he should just be like, be like, ""Uh, Trump- Trump's presidency, such a disaster. It makes me glad I still have my Kenyan citizenship. Uh, and, uh, and did you folks read the op-ed? Uh, nobody respects this guy. Uh, I bet they don't even take his orders at the McDonald's drive-through. Uh, He says, 'Uh, I'll have the chicken McNuggets. They say, 'bitch you're getting the salad.'"""
Jimmy Kimmel,385,76,"I WANT TO APOLOGIZE. WE HAD SO MUCH FUN STUFF PLANNED FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE WORKED ON IT ALL DAY. WE HAD A ""BACHELOR IN PARADISE,"" KIDS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- THERE'S A HORRIBLE NEW PAIR OF UGGS WE WERE GOING TO DISCUSS. I EVEN THOUGHT HEY, MAYBE WE WON'T TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP MUCH TONIGHT. AND THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND ALL MANNER OF STUPID CAME OUT."
Jimmy Kimmel,119,22,AND I'M NOT JOKING WHEN I SAY I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF CERSEI LANNISTER WAS RUNNING THIS COUNTRY AT THIS POINT.
Jimmy Kimmel,260,45,"IT STARTED -- IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND IT ENDED WITH OUR PRESIDENT MAKING AN ANGRY AND PASSIONATE DEFENSE OF WHITE SUPREMACISTS. IT WAS LIKE IF YOUR BOOK CLUB MEETING TURNED INTO A COCK FIGHT. IT REALLY WAS REMARKABLE."
Jimmy Kimmel,107,21,LIKE THE FACT THAT TED CRUZ'S FATHER KILLED JFK AND OBAMA WAS BORN IN KENYA. HE'S A STICKLER FOR THE FACTS.
Jimmy Kimmel,272,48,"AND BY THE WAY, TODAY DAVID DEUX, WHO IS A VERY FINE FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF THE KKK, TWEETED ""THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR YOUR HONESTY AND COURAGE TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLOTTESVILLE."" WHEN DAVID DUKE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY AND COURAGE, SOMETHING HAS GONE AWRY."
Jimmy Kimmel,241,47,"THIS IS SO CRAZY. EVERYBODY'S BEEN ASKING, YOU THINK TRUMP'S GOING TO LAST FOUR YEARS? I'M WONDERING NOW IF ANY OF US ARE GOING TO LAST FOUR YEARS. THIS IS -- I HAVEN'T SCREAMED AT MY TV THIS MUCH SINCE McDREAMY DIED REALLY IS THE LAST TIME."
Jimmy Kimmel,246,41,"AND SO THIS GUY SHOWS UP RIDING DOWN A GOLDEN ESCALATOR. HE'S NOT PART OF THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT. IN FACT, HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. HE'S A BILLIONAIRE. MAYBE. HE'S WRITTEN BOOKS. HE'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT. HE'S NOT EVEN CORRECT USUALLY."
Jimmy Kimmel,182,32,"AND THEN HE BEATS THE ULTIMATE POLITICAL INSIDER, HILLARY CLINTON, A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE -- A WOMAN WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT OF HER MOTHER'S UTERUS IN THE WOMB. FOREVER."
Jimmy Kimmel,139,29,AND THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE LIST. IF I WENT THROUGH ALL OF IT IT WOULD BE LONGER THAN THE MENU AT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. IT WOULD BE HUGE.
Jimmy Kimmel,138,27,AND IT ISN'T GETTING BETTER. IT'S GETTING WORSE. SO YOU CAN DO ONE OF TWO THINGS. YOU CAN DIG IN LIKE CHRIS CHRISTIE AT A HOMETOWN BUFFET.
Jimmy Kimmel,224,41,"AND I'M ASKING YOU, THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP, TO STEP IN AND HELP FOR THE GOOD OF THIS COUNTRY. MIKE PENCE IS READY. HE'S BORING. HE'S RELATIVELY SANE. HE LOOKS LIKE A NEIGHBOR YOU MIGHT BORROW A LAWNMOWER FROM."
Michelle Wolf,68,12,I've never had an entrance make me feel like a magician before.					
Michelle Wolf,98,14, I am very excited to be here in London. This is exciting for me.                                 
Michelle Wolf,208,32,"I was kind of embarrassed about what was happening back home in America, and then I saw what was happening here and I was like, ""Hey, ""you guys are falling apart too!""                                         "
Michelle Wolf,481,99,"""you guys are falling apart too!"" I really, I truly feel bad for Hillary Clinton because no-one likes her. Like, I voted for her, but I don't like her.Like, if she came up to talk to me at a party, I'd be like, ""I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom."" And then if she tried to talk to me in the bathroom, I'd be like, ""I'm sorry, I have to use the men's room.""I just made a life choice.""But you shouldn't like Hillary. She is a bitch. You have to be a bitch to be that powerful."
Michelle Wolf,273,41,We're never going to have a nice lady run for president.You guys had Margaret Thatcher.You didn't call her the Nice Lady.You called the Iron Lady.I don't think that's a word you'd use to describe someone that's fun to hang out with.                                         
Michelle Wolf,310,50," that's fun to hang out with. We're never going to have a nice lady, we're never going to have a woman that's like,""Um, I'd like to be president...""I was a sociology major, ""and I was in a sorority.""And I love brunch.""You can check out my policies on my Pinterest page.""                                        "
Michelle Wolf,257,49," People say you can't make fun of what she wears because she's a woman.  I think you can because it's fun to do.Why are her jackets so big? If any male candidate dressed like her, we would be like,""Why are you dressing like Kim Jong-Un?"" Be a shape. 					"
Michelle Wolf,197,37,"Why are your jackets so big? What are you hiding under there? Is that where all of your e-mails are?But that's the thing, we are supposed to care so much about our bodies as women, you know?					"
Michelle Wolf,193,34,There are even campaigns that we should love our bodies and be confident in our bodies. Or...we could just stop caring about it. Because you know who doesn't care about their bodies? Men. 					
Michelle Wolf,169,32," You know what men are? Successful. Men are presidents, men are CEOs.You've never heard a CEO go, ""I want to get profits up, keep costs down, ""and love me for me."" 					"
Michelle Wolf,463,90,"""3pm, we're going to have a meeting about how I can accept the fact ""that I have my mother's thighs."" Do you know who should care about their bodies? Men! You have weird bodies, men. You're gross.Your balls are gross.  I've seen anyone go like, ""Oh, I can't wait to get his pants off ""and see that weird bag of stuff between his legs."" What is it? It's like when you go to a haunted house and you stick your hand in a jar - you're like, ""Please be grapes"".					"
Michelle Wolf,275,45," Balls seem like a real God whoopsie.Like when you're putting together furnitureand you've got a couple of leftover screws, and you're like, ""Well, those were supposed to go somewhere.""I guess I'll hang them from a satchel."" Even the name sounds like a mistake. 					"
Michelle Wolf,118,21,"""What are you going to call them?"" ""Scrotum."" ""OK.""This is how you know that God didn't care about balls at all.					"
Michelle Wolf,647,131," Everything else important, he covered in bone.  Balls, he was like, ""Let 'em fly!"" You are so lucky we get our faces near them.			If a woman puts your balls in her mouth, you should pay her a lot of money. And not in like a prostitute way, in like a ""I don't know how else to say thank you. ""This is a very nice thing you just did to me. ""And you didn't get any pleasure out of it."" There's not a single woman that's like,""That's what does it for me."" ""You are more of a saint than Mother Teresa for that.""	There's no way she ever did it. 					 I get one wrinkle, my career is over. I have to put paint on my face just to leave my home.					"
Michelle Wolf,247,41," And you guys get to walk around with those wrinkly, dangling bags of crap.You should have to put make-up on them! Or at the very least, googly eyes. I don't know if it'd be better or worse, but it'd be fun.                                        "
Michelle Wolf,203,39," He's happy, he's sad, he lost his boner. I don't know how we ever let you guys get away with calling our boobs saggy. Your balls are saggy. You should wear a bra. And you make it fancy. [CHEERING]					"
Michelle Wolf,512,87,"I don't know, I think women, we have weird priorities. We care so much about our wedding.We'll even say things - ""I want to be a princess on my wedding day. ""I'm going to be a princess.""I'm a grown adult woman who would like to be a princess."" I'm like, ""All right, you want to be a princess? ""Then I'm going to make you marry a man you've never met ""in order to secure a French alliance.                              ""And guess what, princess? He's not going to love you.                                        "
Michelle Wolf,279,53," ""Your parents wished you were a boy. ""Happy wedding day, princess."" And we'll say things like, ""It's my day, it's my special day.""I don't think you can call it your day if your dad is paying for it.	I think it's his day, and I think it's a really weird day for him."
Michelle Wolf,186,33,"We should date shorter guys more often, they're really nice.The only problem is a lot of times when you go for walks, you have to be like, ""All right, speed up, little buddy.					"
Michelle Wolf,373,71,"The real reason I want Hillary Clinton to be president is because I want Bill Clinton to be the first gentleman.Mostly because the spouse of the president is the one who sometimes gives tours of the White House, and I would love to see Bill be like, ""These are our drapes. ""As you can see, they are navy. ""But if you shine a black light on them, boy, do they glow!""					"
Michelle Wolf,139,26," Every time he bit his lip from behind a podium, I thought he was trying to get rid of a boner. Like... ""Hillary, Hillary, Hillary."" 					"
Jimmy Fallon,292,58," -Let's get to some news here. It just came out that President Trump is going to meet with Kanye West at the White Houseon Thursday. And this is -- this is interesting. They both think they're going to a Twitter intervention for the other person.[ Laughter and applause ] "
Jimmy Fallon,190,36," ""You know why we're here, right?"" That's right, Trump is meeting with Kanye at the White House.Trump will be like, ""I wish you had been here last week. I had a Supreme Court seat to fill."" "
Jimmy Fallon,474,84," But Kanye isn't the only celebrity Trump's been thinking about lately.  He was asked about Taylor Swift endorsing Democrats in the midterms. Check out what he said.  -Taylor Swift's jumping into politics. What do you have to say to that? -And what did she say?  -She said wants people to vote for Democrats.-Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25% less now. [ Audience ""oh""s ] -Then Trump said, ""I knew she was trouble when she walked in."" [ Laughter and applause ] "
Jimmy Fallon,357,68," -- I just I think it's for the best."" Is it? Trump's been busy. Last night he hosted a ceremony for new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and the other justices were there to watch. Look at this photo there. Oh, God. [ Laughter ] Oh, man. That looks like Melania's side of the aisle at her wedding, you know what I'm saying? [ Laughter and applause ] "
Jimmy Fallon,234,40,"Actually, Trump took a moment to thank the other justices,but for some reason he kept saying the words ""thank you"" really softly.Watch this. This is odd. -Justice Thomas. Thank you. [ Laughter ] Justice Alito. Thank you. [ Laughter ] "
Jimmy Fallon,372,68," You see this? At a rally this past weekend, President Trump talked about answering calls on Air Force One. But he had a little trouble with the word ""phone."" Check this out. -I had that phone working. I had that ""fern"" working on that plane. -Fern. [ Laughter ] -Fern. Yeah. While -- he had that fern working. We noticed Trump has trouble pronouncing things all the time."
Jimmy Fallon,215,46,"So with that in mind, it's time to play ""Talk Like Trump.""Here we go. ♪♪ -♪ Talk like Trump ♪ -♪ Pretty simple words ♪ -♪ Talk like Trump ♪ -♪ Huge ♪ ♪♪ [ Cheers and applause ] -All right, so here's how this works. "
Jimmy Fallon,279,58,"I'm going to see if anyone can guess how the President is going to mispronounce a simple word. And if you get it right, you get a prize. And if you get it wrong, you still get a prize. All right, raise your hand if you want to play ""Talk Like Trump."" Who wants to play? Come on. "
Jimmy Fallon,211,41," Anyway, I thought I'd finally get back out there because since I left, things are -- they're messier than a sales rack at Marshalls. [ Laughter ] Oh, look, I got a big pair of oversized panties. [ Laughter ] "
Jimmy Fallon,193,41,"I scored a hockey mask with Life Savers stuck to it. [ Laughter ] I got a wooden owl that looks like Uncle Dick, or whatever it is. You know. A lot of stuff at Marshalls. [ Laughter ] So look. "
Jimmy Fallon,256,44,"Seriously though, I've got some quick and easy tips to help you in the upcoming election, okay?  First, just make time to vote. It only takes five minutes to register on www.vote.gov.And here's another tip. Vote for smart people. [ Laughter and applause ] "
Jimmy Fallon,314,58,"I know that smart can sometimes be boring, but believe me,boring gets the job done. Crazy is only good when you're like a Real Housewife who hasn't gotten any screen time and it's, like, two episodes left to the finale, you know what I mean?You got to flip a table sometimes, Lisa Rinna. [ Laughter and applause ] "
Jimmy Fallon,272,57," And finally -- and this is a big one. If a big, burly Russian that you don't know -- like a big, big Russian dude -- [ Light laughter ] He tell you to vote for somebody on Facebook, don't do it. [ Laughter ] You just tell him, you just say, ""Oh, hell nyet."" And log off. "
